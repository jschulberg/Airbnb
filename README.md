# Linear-Regression
In this script, I will employ a few facets of linear and logistic regression analysis to analyze the following three datasets:  

 1. **AirBnB** -- This dataset contains a variety of indicators related to housing factors to predict on the price of a house  
 2. **Direct Marketing** -- This dataset contains a variety of variables used to determine the Amount Spent on advertising  
 3. **Titanic** -- This dataset contains various factors of the individuals aboard the Titanic. I will use those factors to predict whether someone survived
 
The directory is organized as follows:  
| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Code | This section includes all of the data wrangling and predictive modeling R code used on the U.S. Crime dataset. |
| Data | This section includes the main dataset used throughout the analyses. |
| Viz | This section includes all of the main visualizations generated by the R Code in the Code section. |
